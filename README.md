# Pac-Mania
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders</a> is an old arcade game about destroying alien spaceships. In the original game, you control a lone projectile-shooting spaceship and must destroy an enemy fleet before they overrun your position or shoot you down. This project uses similar mechanics from the original game, instead of controlling a lone spaceship, you must feed the angry ghosts oranges since they are allergic to them to make them disappear. Watch out though! Pac-Man is allergic to strawberries so make sure to avoid them at all costs!

This is an unfinished java-based game that I am currently developing in order to
learn more about object-oriented programming and the different functionalities of java.
